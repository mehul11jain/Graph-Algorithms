/**
 * The union() and find() in the naive implementation has the worst case time complexity is linear. 
 * The trees created to represent subsets can be skewed and can become like a linked list. 
 * 
 * The above operations can be optimized to O(Log n) in worst case.
 * The idea is to always attach smaller depth tree under the root of the deeper tree. 
 * This technique is called union by rank. 
 * 
 * The second optimization to naive method is Path Compression. 
 * The idea is to flatten the tree when find() is called. 
 * When find() is called for an element x, root of the tree is returned. 
 * The find() operation traverses up from x to find root. 
 * The idea of path compression is to make the found root as parent of x 
 * so that we donâ€™t have to traverse all intermediate nodes again
